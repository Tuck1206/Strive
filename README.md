##  **About the App**

**Strive** is a modern web application designed to help users **track their fitness journey**, **record workouts**, and **monitor progress** through achievements and levels.

### **Why I Built It**
I built this app beacuse of personal reasoning. I recently just started my fitness journey again and was searching for apps to keep track of my progession made.   Upon searching, I relized that most apps are boring or out-dated and really don't motivate a users progression with achievments or awards.
In a world filled with overcomplicated fitness trackers, **Strive** offers a clean and motivating experience. It gives users the tools to stay consistent â€” without the noise. 

**Strive** helps users:
- Log workouts easily  
- Track XP and level progression  
- View achievements as milestones  
- Stay accountable through simplicity and style
